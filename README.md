# Streamlit 
Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create web applications for data science and machine learning projects. With Streamlit, you can turn data scripts into shareable web apps without requiring extensive web development knowledge. It's designed to be user-friendly, allowing developers to quickly build interactive and responsive data-driven applications.

Key Features of Streamlit:

    Rapid Prototyping: Streamlit enables you to create interactive web applications with just a few lines of Python code. This allows for quick prototyping and experimentation.

    Data Visualization: You can easily visualize data using charts, graphs, plots, and maps, making it ideal for presenting insights from your data analysis.

    Widgets and Interactivity: Streamlit provides widgets like sliders, buttons, text inputs, and more. These widgets enable users to interact with your application and customize its behavior.

    Customization: While Streamlit offers a simple way to create apps, you can also customize the appearance, layout, and style of your applications to match your preferences.

    Integration with Data Libraries: Streamlit seamlessly integrates with popular data manipulation and visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and others.

    Deployment: Deploying Streamlit apps is straightforward. You can share your apps on the web using Streamlit sharing or deploy them on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.

    Machine Learning Integration: You can integrate machine learning models and algorithms directly into your Streamlit apps, allowing users to interact with and test your models.




In this Project is the demonstration of streamlit to build a user friendly application.
The application should consist of three pages, each serving specific functionalities.<br>
● The Employee data entry page should allow users to input information such
as Employee Number (Empno), Employee Name (Ename), Job, and
Department Number (Deptno).<br>
● The Department data entry page should enable users to input data for
departments, including Department Number (Deptno), Department
Name(dname), and Location(loc).<br>
● Finally, the third page should visualize the joined employee and department
data table based on the common 'Deptno' field.<br>

# Install dependencies
