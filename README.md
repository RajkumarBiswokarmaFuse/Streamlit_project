# Streamlit_project 
In this Project is the demonstration of streamlit to build a user friendly application.
The application should consist of three pages, each serving specific functionalities.<br>
● The Employee data entry page should allow users to input information such
as Employee Number (Empno), Employee Name (Ename), Job, and
Department Number (Deptno).<br>
● The Department data entry page should enable users to input data for
departments, including Department Number (Deptno), Department
Name(dname), and Location(loc).<br>
● Finally, the third page should visualize the joined employee and department
data table based on the common 'Deptno' field.<br>
